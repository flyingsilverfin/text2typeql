341,What are the names of organizations that have a CEO who is younger than 40 years old?,"MATCH (o:Organization)-[:HAS_CEO]->(ceo:Person)
WHERE date().year - toInteger(left(ceo.id, 4)) < 40
RETURN o.name",TypeQL lacks string manipulation (left()) and date functions (date().year) needed to extract birth year from person_id and compute age
708,Which 3 organizations have the most detailed organizational summaries?,"MATCH (o:Organization) WHERE o.summary IS NOT NULL RETURN o.name AS organization, o.summary AS summary ORDER BY size(o.summary) DESC LIMIT 3",TypeQL limitation: no string length function (size() equivalent) to order by summary length
783,What are the names of organizations that have Accenture as their CEO?,"MATCH (o:Organization)-[:HAS_CEO]->(p:Person {name: 'Julie Spellman Sweet'})
WHERE p.summary IS NOT NULL AND p.summary CONTAINS 'Accenture'
RETURN o.name","Invalid question: Asks for organizations where Accenture (an organization) is their CEO, but CEOs must be persons, not organizations. The question is semantically invalid and cannot be answered."
843,Who are the CEOs of organizations that have been dissolved but mentioned in recent articles?,"MATCH (o:Organization)-[:HAS_CEO]->(ceo:Person)
WHERE o.isDissolved = true
  AND EXISTS {
    (o)<-[:MENTIONS]-(a:Article)
    WHERE a.date >= datetime() - duration('P1Y')
  }
RETURN ceo.name AS ceoName, o.name AS orgName",TypeQL limitation: Cannot express relative date (recent articles) - requires now() function for datetime() - duration() calculation which TypeQL does not support
